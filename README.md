The aim of this Project is to investigate the factors contributing to the crime rate in London. This is achieved by using machine learning and data mining models. The investigation aims to identify whether crime rate in London is as a result of unemployment, homelessness and below the living wage. As explained above, to achieve these aims, several analyses were carried out using correlation, Regression, Clustering and Classification
